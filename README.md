# Stores-Sales-Revenue

# Project

In this project, I have created a dashboard for a multinational departmental store chain to have a quick glance at their progress in terms of different KPIs, which will allow them to make necessary adjustments in order to reach their targets.

# Dataset

The dataset contains 5000 rows of sales data distributed across 12 columns as follows:

Region         | Geographical regions where stores are located <br><br>
Country	       | Countries where stores are located <br><br>
Item Type      | Type of item ordered <br><br>
Rep Name       | Name of the representative who handled the order <br><br>
Sales Channel  | Whether the order was online or offline <br><br>
Order Priority | Priority of the Order Made <br><br>
Order Date     | Date the order was placed <br><br>
Order ID       | 9 digit order ID <br><br>
Ship Date      | Date the order was shipped <br><br>
Units Sold     | Units of the product ordered <br><br>
Unit Price     | Price per item <br><br>
Unit Cost      | Cost per item <br><br>
